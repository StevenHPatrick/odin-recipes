      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups  all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cups  shortening</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of  cold  water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour and salt in a medium sized bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening till pieces are pea-sized.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of part of the flour/salt/shortening mixture. Gently work in the water with a fork or hands. Push moistened dough to the side of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Repeat the last step for the rest of the tablespoons, 1 tablespoon at a till until the dough is lightly moistened.</li>
        <li>Form the moist dough into a ball. Try to get all of the mixture into the ball, leaving behind a mostly cleaned bowl. Split the ball in two halves. One halve with be for the top crust; the other will be for the bottom.</li>
        <li>To create the crust, lightly dampen a clean surface with water. Then take 2 large pieces of wax paper and place them onto the surface, overlapping on one long edge by about 1 1/2 inch. Place one dough ball in the middle of these two wax papers with a third similarly large piece of wax paper placed on top of that. With your dough sandwiched between wax paper, we are now going to flatten the dough ball down by rolling from the center of the ball to the edges until the dough is flattened to a foot wide circle in diameter. Move the top wax paper to keen the wax paper between the dough and the rolling pin as you flatten the dough. If any wax paper rips; replace said wax paper with a new sheet.</li>
        <li>To transfer the crust to the pie, move the top wax paper to cover the bottom half of the flattened dough. Grab the bottom wax paper not covered by the the paper and begin folding the dough over the middle wax paper. Separate the folded wax paper with the dough and return the paper to the surface. Repeat with the other half of the flattened dough. Once both sides of the dough are separated, position the top wax over half of the dough, just like how we did when we separated the dough from the bottom wax paper. Fold the half not covered by wax paper over using the bottom wax paper and then return the wax paper to its original position. Now, the dough should be sandwiching the top wax paper with a bottom wax paper underneath. Lift up that bottom wax paper and place it on the pie plate where the middle of the dough lines up with the middle of the pie plate. Undo the folded dough into the pie plate and flatten it into the corners of the plate.</li>
        <li>Trim the crust to be even with the side of the pie plate.</li>
        <li>Transfer the filling to the pastry-lined pie plate.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the other half ball of dough, with the exception of putting the dough on the filling instead of in the pie plate. Trim the dough about 1/2 inch from the edge of the pie plate.</li>
        <li>Fold the edge of the top dough around the edge of the bottom and then crimp the edge.</li>
        <li>Pierce the pie with a fork before baking in the oven. Follow the pie filler recipe for how long to bake.
